ðŸš€ Just finished building "MakeMyday" - a full-stack daily journal app!

I created this application to help track daily experiences with a simple rating system. Here's what I built:

ðŸ’» Backend: Python with FastAPI providing a clean RESTful API for managing journal entries
ðŸ“± Frontend: React Native mobile app using Expo for cross-platform compatibility

Key features:
â€¢ Create daily notes with content and 1-5 star ratings
â€¢ View, edit, and delete past entries
â€¢ Clean, intuitive mobile interface
â€¢ Comprehensive unit testing

This project demonstrates how quickly you can build a functional cross-platform application with modern tools. The combination of FastAPI + React Native provides a great developer experience while creating performant applications.

What's your go-to tech stack for building full-stack applications quickly?
